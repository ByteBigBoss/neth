2. Uncomment or replace the import statements based on the UI library you want to use.
3. Update the component in the JSX with the corresponding library component.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@mantine/core' // Example for Mantine
// import { Button } from '@nextui-org/react'  // Example for NextUI
```

### Customizing Components

You can customize any component by navigating to the respective library folder inside the `components/` directory. For example, to customize a `Button` component for Shadcn UI:

```bash
